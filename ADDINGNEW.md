## Information for Adding Your Own

### Chat Limits

The maximum amount of characters you can type into CS:GO's chat is 127 \***if**\* they are from the standard (not extended) [ASCII Character Set](ascii).

The chat in CS:GO takes a maximum of 127 bytes with standard ASCII characters taking up 1 byte. If a character is **not** in the standard ASCII set (like an emoji ☜) it can take up to **4 bytes**.

You can check how many bytes there are in a string of characters here: https://mothereff.in/byte-counter. If you paste a copypasta with emojis into the counter you will see the character and byte counts differ.

### Emojis

Most emojis will not appear in the chat, however here is some that do:
