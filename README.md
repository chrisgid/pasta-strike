# pasta-strike
All your favourite copypastas in a CS:GO config

## Installing
* Place pasta-strike.cfg into the cfg folder inside the install directory of CS:GO, usually located here:

  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

* Load up CS:GO

* Open the console with the tilde key `~`

* Type `exec pasta-strike.cfg` and hit enter

* In game type any alias in the list into the console to write out your pasta in the chat

  For example type `shrug` to write ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ in chat



## Adding New Pastas

Keep strings to a maximum length of **127** as this is the maximum amount of characters you can type into CS:GO's chat
