# pasta-strike

All of your favourite copypastas and text emojis in a CS:GO config

## Installing Pastas

1. [Download **pasta-strike.cfg**][pasta-cfg] and add it to the cfg folder inside the install directory of CS:GO, usually located here:

   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

2. [Download **autoexec.cfg**][auto-cfg] and add it to the same directory

    **OR**

   If you already have an autoexec.cfg file, open it in a text editor and add `exec pasta-strike.cfg` to the end

3. Start up CS:GO and your copypastas will be loaded
