# pasta-strike
All your favourite copypastas in a CS:GO config

## Installing
1. Place pasta-strike.cfg into the cfg folder inside the install directory of CS:GO, usually located here:

    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

2. Load up CS:GO

3. Open the console with the tilde key `~`

4. Type `exec pasta-strike.cfg` and hit enter

5. In game type any alias in the list into the console to write out your pasta in the chat

    For example type `shrug` to write ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ in chat



## Adding New Pastas

* Keep strings to a maximum length of **127** as this is the maximum amount of characters you can type into CS:GO's chat
