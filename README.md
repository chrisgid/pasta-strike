# pasta-strike
All of your favourite copypastas in a CS:GO config

## Installing Pastas
1. Add **pasta-strike.cfg** to the cfg folder inside the install directory of CS:GO, usually located here:

    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

2. Add **autoexec.cfg** to the same directory

    (If you already have an autoexec.cfg file, open it in a text editor and add `exec pasta-strike.cfg` to the end)

3. Start up CS:GO and your copypastas will be loaded


## Using Pastas

1. In game open the console with the tilde key `~`

    (Enabled by going to **Settings > Game Settings** and setting **Enable Developer Console (~)** to Yes)

2. Type an alias from the list into the console and hit enter to write out your pasta in the chat

    For example type `/shrug` to write ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ in chat



## Adding New Pastas

Keep strings to a maximum length of **127** as this is the maximum amount of characters you can type into CS:GO's chat. Use this to check string lengths: http://www.charactercountonline.com/

Most emojis do not appear in chat so it is recommended to remove them, however here is a list of the ones that do work:
