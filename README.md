# pasta-strike
All of your favourite copypastas and text emojis in a CS:GO config

## Installing Pastas
1. [Download **pasta-strike.cfg**](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chrisgid/pasta-strike@latest/pasta-strike.cfg) and add it to the cfg folder inside the install directory of CS:GO, usually located here:

    `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`

2. [Download **autoexec.cfg**](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/chrisgid/pasta-strike@latest/autoexec.cfg) and add it to the same directory

    (If you already have an autoexec.cfg file, open it in a text editor and add `exec pasta-strike.cfg` to the end)

3. Start up CS:GO and your copypastas will be loaded


## Using Pastas

1. In game open the console with the tilde key `~`

    (Enabled by going to **Settings > Game Settings** and setting **Enable Developer Console (~)** to Yes)

2. Type an alias from the list into the console and hit enter to write out your pasta in the chat

    For example type `/shrug` to write ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ in chat



## Adding New Pastas

The maximum amount of characters you can type into CS:GO's chat is 127 \***if**\* they are from the standard (not extended) [ASCII Character Set](https://ascii.cl/). 

The chat in CS:GO takes a maximum of 127 bytes with standard ASCII characters taking up 1 byte. If a character is not in the standard ASCII set (like an emoji ☜) it can take up to 4 bytes of information.

You can check how many bytes there are in a string of characters here: https://mothereff.in/byte-counter. If you paste a copypasta with emojis into the counter you will see the character and byte counts differ.

However, most emojis do not appear in chat so it is recommended to remove them anyway, but here is a list of the ones that do work:
